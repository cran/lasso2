R package "lasso2"
==================

I have ported these from the Dec.1999 version as available ( for S-plus )
at  http://www.maths.uwa.edu.au/~berwin/software/lasso.html
in order to use them for R.

Berwin Turlach <himself> will probably take over maintenance of this
package after while since "lasso2" is one of his ongoing research projects.

Feedback (by E-mail to me and or Berwin) is very welcome!
