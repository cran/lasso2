<H1>Lasso2 (L1 Constrained Estimation Routines)</H1>

Just a <EM>copy</EM> of
 <A HREF="http://www.maths.uwa.edu.au/~berwin/software/lasso.html">
  http://www.maths.uwa.edu.au/~berwin/software/lasso.html</A>
as of 2002-03-11.

<H2>Release 2.1, released on 9 December 1999</H2>

<P> Via this page you may access two shar files with C routines for
solving regression problems in which a constraint is imposed on the
sum of the absolute values of the parameter estimates.  The shar file
also includes interface routines to S-PLUS and documentation files.
To see what changed since the last release, check the
<a href="Lasso2.ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>.</P>

<UL>
  <LI> The <a href="Lasso2">first shar file</a> contains just the C and
S-PLUS code and a manual for the library  (roughly 950kB).
  <LI> The <a href="Lasso2doc">second shar file</a> contains
additionally postscript files for most of the manuscripts mentioned
below (roughly 2.5MB).
</UL>

The S-PLUS interface was developed together with Bill Venables and
uses the modelling functions of S-PLUS.  The underlying C engine is
based on the algorithm described in
