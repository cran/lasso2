	* src/lasso.h: define macro Sprintf() = Rprintf() in R, else = printf()
	* src/lasso.c: s/printf/Sprintf/

	* R/gl1ce.q (gl1ce): replace as.family; use is.R() for R
	differences (such that this still runs in S+ as before!).
	s/check.vector/Cvector/ {readability}.
	Many more (using R's glm.fit()) -- now +/- working
	* R/summary.q (summary.gl1ce):     R adaptions
	* R/print.q (print.summary.gl1ce): R adaptions

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): 1.0-1
	  (as Berwin explained, "2" is no version number!)

	* man/deviance.l1ce.Rd: and almost all (!!) others:
	  added \keyword{}; added quite a few hyper \link{} s;
	  sometimes merged the almost identical *.l1ce and *.l1celist
	  files; added missing argument lists; ....

	* R/*.q: generic and methods *must* have maching argument lists!

	* pre-version (Version): 2.1-0 made available for Berwin to look
	at.

	* MM-NOTES: 1) - 7) explaining open questions

	* DESCRIPTION: a first unreleased version at least runs
	  R CMD check to completion; still many warnings

	* R/l1ce.q (l1ce): cosmetic;
	  added qr.rtr.inv()  {and a note on why I think one should change..}
	  fixed two severe `typos' :
	   1) single-bound && something.to.sweep.out ("orig" shows)
	   2) multibound case: `fit' was used before defined
