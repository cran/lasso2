	* First.lib.template: Changed to Release 0.11 and saved as snapshot.

	* l1ce.q:
	The `contrasts' and `assign' result from model.matrix are now returned
	as components of l1ce objects and attributes of l1celist objects.

Sun Sep 13 04:08:42 1998  Berwin Turlach  <bturlach@stats.adelaide.edu.au>

	* First.lib.template: Changed to Release 0.10 and saved as snapshot.

	Made `gcv' a generic method.  Programmed and tested `gcv.l1ce' and
	`gcv.l1celist'.

	* summary.q: Initial revision

Fri Sep 11 08:55:26 1998  Berwin Turlach  <bturlach@stats.adelaide.edu.au>

	* gcv.q: Initial revision

Thu Sep 10 10:23:10 1998  Berwin Turlach  <bturlach@stats.adelaide.edu.au>

	* First.lib.template: Changed to Release 0.9 and saved as snapshot.

	* l1ce.q:
	The terms in the `formula' are calculated and given back too.  We need
	those in the predict function.  Minor cosmetic changes to
	error/warning messages.

	* misc.q:
	Corrected bug in transfer from attributes of objects of class l1celist
	to components of objects of class l1ce.  Streamlines the code and
	works also if new attributes/components are added.

	* predict.q: Adapted from `predict.mlm'.  Programmed and tested.

	* predict.q: Initial revision

Wed Sep  9 11:26:54 1998  Berwin Turlach  <bturlach@stats.adelaide.edu.au>

	* First.lib.template: Changed to Release 0.8 and saved as snapshot.

	* vcov.q: Fixed but in tib.covmat (didn't take absolute values).
	Fixed typos in vcov.l1ce.  Added code that calculates the degrees of
	freedom by calculating the trace of the "hat" matrix.  The parameter
	s2hat was dropped, not the covaraince matrix is returned in a list as
	`cov.unscaled' together with the degrees of freedom (`df', vector with
	two values).
	Programmed and debugged vcov.l1celist.

Tue Sep  8 10:47:42 1998  Berwin Turlach  <bturlach@stats.adelaide.edu.au>

	* First.lib.template: Changed to Release 0.7 and saved as snapshot.

	* vcov.q:
	Programmed and tested `vcov.l1ce'.  Perhaps some thought is still
	needed for a sensible default for the parameter `s2hat'.

	* misc.q:
	Changed `[.l1celist' and `[[.l1celist'' to take into account the
	changes made to `l1ce' wrt parameters returned.

	* l1ce.q: Added check whether a dataframe is given down.
	Added check whether variables are left over after sweeping out.
	Changed what values are returned, these changes were necessary in
	order to be able to calculate the covariance matrix of the estimates.

Mon Sep  7 07:18:08 1998  Berwin Turlach  <bturlach@stats.adelaide.edu.au>

	* First.lib.template: Changed to Release 0.6 and saved as snapshot.

	* l1ce.q:
	Changed X.to.C[,-name.matches] to X.to.C[,-name.matches,drop=F] so
	that the result remains a matrix.  Explicitly added as.double() when
	the guess for the constrained parameter is given down to C.  If a
	vector of constraints is given, then the routine uses now
	.C("mult_lasso") instead of repeated calls to .C("lasso") (saves
	initialisation work in the C routine).

	* deviance.q: Added `deviance.l1celist'.

Sat Sep  5 06:49:59 1998  Berwin Turlach  <bturlach@stats.adelaide.edu.au>

	* First.lib.template: Changed to Release 0.5 and saved as snapshot.

	* residuals.q: Added `residuals.l1celist'.

	* print.q: Added `print.l1celist'.

	* plot.q: Changed to make use of the methods `aux' and `coef'.

	* misc.q:
	Changed `[[.l1celist' such that indexes out of bounds are correctly
	handled.  Added `[.l1celist' and `aux' as generic method.
	`aux.l1celist' returns a matrix with the bounds (relative and
	absolute) and the Lagrangians.

	* l1ce.q: Renamed the parameter `constraint' to `bound'.

	* fitted.q:
	Added fitted.l1ce (practically fitted.default) and fitted.l1celist.

	* coef.q: Added coef.l1celist.

	* fitted.q: Initial revision

Fri Sep  4 11:28:13 1998  Berwin Turlach  <bturlach@stats.adelaide.edu.au>

	* First.lib.template: Changed to Release 0.4 and saved as snapshot.

	Preparation for implementing the vcov function.  Checked in in order
	to rename all files from *.sf to *.q.

	* plot.q: First go at plot.l1celist.

	* l1ce.q:
	Added the possibility that constraint is a vector.  In this case an
	object of class "l1celist" is returned.

	* vcov.q, plot.q: Initial revision

Mon Aug 31 07:40:46 1998  Berwin Turlach  <bturlach@stats.adelaide.edu.au>

	* First.lib.template: Changed to Release 0.3 and saved as snapshot.

	* l1ce.sf:
	Renamed a variable from `m' to `p' so that it would not overwrite the
	variable holding the information about the model.

	* print.sf: Adapted from printed.lm, programmed and debugged.

	* print.sf: Initial revision

	* deviance.sf: Adapted from deviance.lm, programmed and debugged.

	* l1ce.sf:
	Renamed some components to have same names as in objects returned by
	lm.

	* coef.sf: Renamed beta to coefficients.

	* deviance.sf: Initial revision

	* l1ce.sf:
	Corrected an error in the way the formula were handled (noticable when
	weights were present).  Added heaps of bells and whistles.

	* residuals.sf: Adapted from residuals.lm, programmed and debugged.

Fri Aug 28 08:02:11 1998  Berwin Turlach  <bturlach@stats.adelaide.edu.au>

	* residuals.sf: Initial revision

Sun Aug 16 02:50:33 1998  Berwin Turlach  <bturlach@stats.adelaide.edu.au>

	* formula.util.sf:
	Corrected merge.formula such that it handles long formulae correctly.
	(deparse may return a *vector* of strings.)

	* coef.l1ce.sf: Initial revision

Tue Aug 11 06:15:18 1998  Berwin Turlach  <bturlach@stats.adelaide.edu.au>
